    //Examples: a0. a : Armor 0 : Cracked Bat. Code for that : ArmorNames[Item.iID]; Returns: "Cracked Bat". Your Welcome github ppl ~Leviathenn
    /*
     * a0 = a | 0. now they are split a0 is now a | 0. Lets check our new array. Array: [a, 0]
     *  The first letter in our array is a. 'a' corrosponds to the Category.
     * 'a' Stands for the Armor Category, so when we check for item ids, we will check in th armor class.
     *  '0' stands for the index that we search for in the ArmorNames array. 
     * ArmorNames Array Example: {" Cracked Bat ", "Stone CHestplate", "Stone Helment"};
     * Lets check our array: {" Cracked Bat ", "Stone CHestplate", "Stone Helment"}. Looks good.
     * But we need to label our Indexs, Since were not writing the actual code. Lets take a look!
     * {" Cracked Bat ": 0, "Stone CHestplate": 1, "Stone Helment": 2};
     * As we can see. For example, The Item "Cracked Bat" has the ID 0 in the Armor Category!
